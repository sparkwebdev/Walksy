      </strong>
      <em>
        {" "}
        We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store
        your information.
      </em>
      <br />
      We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and
      pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we
      use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in
      our Cookie Notice.
      <br />
      <strong>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>
        <em>In Short: </em>
      </strong>
      <em>
        {" "}
        We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
        purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by
        law.
      </em>
      <br />
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
      your personal information for longer than twelve (12) months past the
      start of idle period of the user's account.
      <br />
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.
      <br />
      <strong>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong>
      <br />
      <strong>
        <em>In Short: </em>
      </strong>
      <em>
        {" "}
        We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organizational and technical security measures.
      </em>
      <br />
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
      measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
      process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
      information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
      storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
      promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
      third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
      collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
      our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
      information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only
      access the App within a secure environment.
      <br />
      <strong>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong>

      <em>
        {" "}
        <em></em>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and

      </em>
      <br />

      protection laws.
      <br />
      If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
      you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note
      however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
      its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal
      information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
      consent. If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are
      unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right
      to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can

      <strong>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
      <br />
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
      uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy notice. <br />

      such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below,
      and include the email address associated with your account and a statement
      that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly
