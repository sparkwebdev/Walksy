          <br />
          We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
          and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about
          how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is

          <br />
          We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
          necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
          longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,

          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
          personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
          information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your

          We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
          measures designed to protect the security of any personal information
          we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
          information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
          information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
          we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
          unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security,
          and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
          Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
          transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your
          own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.

          <strong>Account Information</strong>
          <br />
          If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
          your account or terminate your account, you can:
          <ul>
            <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
          </ul>
          Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
          delete your account and information from our active databases.
          However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
          troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our
          Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

            <u>Opting out of email marketing:</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by
          clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by
          contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be
          removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still
          communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails
          that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to
          respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To
          otherwise opt-out, you may:
          <ul>
            <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
          <br />
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
          notice. <br />
